# Therapist Login/Logout Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Login Page Auto-Redirected
**Problem:** Visiting `/therapist/login` would check auth and redirect to dashboard if logged in.

**Fix:** Removed auto-redirect logic
- Login page now **always shows the form**
- No more checking auth on load
- Direct access to login page anytime

### Issue 2: Logout Went to Wrong Page
**Problem:** Logout redirected to `/login` (user login) instead of `/therapist/login`

**Fix:** Updated logout action
- Now redirects to `/therapist/login?fresh_login=true`
- Clears session on arrival
- Clean logout flow

## 🎯 New Behavior

### When You Visit `/therapist/login`:
1. ✅ Shows login form immediately (no redirect)
2. ✅ No "Loading..." spinner
3. ✅ Works even if you have an active session
4. ✅ If `?fresh_login=true` param exists, clears session

### When You Click Logout:
1. ✅ Clears all auth cookies
2. ✅ Redirects to `/therapist/login?fresh_login=true`
3. ✅ Session cleared automatically on arrival
4. ✅ Shows fresh login form
