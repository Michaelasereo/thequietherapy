## üö® 3. 8-HOUR TRIAGE PLAN (Critical Path Only)

### Priority 1: Fix Video Recording (4 hours) üî¥ CRITICAL

**Problem**: Session recording and SOAP note generation inconsistent

**Solution**:
```typescript
// app/video-session/[sessionId]/page.tsx
// Priority fixes:

1. Simplify recording flow (30 min)
   - Use browser MediaRecorder ONLY
   - Remove complex Daily.co recording
   - One-button start/stop

2. Fix transcription endpoint (1 hour)
   - app/api/transcribe/route.ts
   - Ensure OpenAI Whisper integration works
   - Add error handling

3. Fix SOAP notes endpoint (1.5 hours)
   - app/api/ai/generate-soap-notes/route.ts
   - Use reliable AI provider (DeepSeek or OpenAI)
   - Add fallback handling

4. Test end-to-end (1 hour)
   - Create test session
   - Record audio
   - Verify transcription
   - Verify SOAP notes
```

**Acceptable Workaround for Demo**:
- Use manual note-taking as backup
- Document that AI notes are "coming soon"
- Focus demo on booking + video connection (core value)

---

### Priority 2: Payment Polish (2 hours) üü° HIGH

**Problem**: Webhook handling incomplete, edge cases not handled

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Quick fixes:

1. Add idempotency to webhooks (30 min)
   - app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts
   - Check for duplicate events before processing

2. Improve error messages (30 min)
   - Add Nigerian context-aware errors
   - Suggest alternatives (bank transfer, etc.)

3. Add payment status debugging (1 hour)
   - Dashboard shows payment status
   - Admin can see failed payments
```

**Acceptable Workaround for Demo**:
- Manually add credits for demo users
- Document as "beta payment system"
- Use promo codes for testing

---

### Priority 3: Mobile UX Polish (2 hours) üü° MEDIUM

**Problem**: Mobile layout rough, touch targets too small

**Solution**:
```css
/* Quick fixes in globals.css */

1. Increase touch targets (30 min)
   button { min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px; }
   
2. Fix viewport zoom (15 min)
   input[type="email"], input[type="password"] {
     font-size: 16px; /* Prevents iOS zoom */
   }
   
3. Improve mobile booking flow (1 hour)
   - Stack form fields vertically
   - Increase button sizes
   - Add spacing
   
4. Test on real device (15 min)
   - Chrome DevTools mobile view
   - Test on actual phone
```

**Acceptable Workaround for Demo**:
- Demo on desktop only
- Add "Mobile app coming soon" message
- Document known mobile issues

---

### Total: 8 Hours of Focused Work

**After these fixes**: Platform is **90% demo-ready**

**Can cut corners**:
- ‚ùå Real-time sync (use refresh)
- ‚ùå Advanced error handling (basic messages OK)
- ‚ùå Whiteboard (not essential for MVP)
- ‚ùå Automated tests (manual testing sufficient)
