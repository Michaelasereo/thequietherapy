## 🧪 **How to Test Everything**

### Test 1: Login Flow
1. Go to `/therapist/login` while logged in
2. Should redirect to dashboard immediately
3. No dashboard UI should flash

### Test 2: Dashboard
1. Go to `/therapist/dashboard`
2. Should show "Welcome back, Opeyemi Michael Asere"
3. Avatar in top-right shows (or shows "O" if no image)

### Test 3: Profile Update
1. Go to `/therapist/dashboard/settings`
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Change any field (bio, phone, etc.)
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. ✅ Fields should persist
6. ✅ Form shouldn't clear
7. ✅ Should stay on settings page

### Test 4: Avatar Upload
1. Still in settings, click "Edit Profile"  
2. Click "Upload Image"
3. Select an image file
4. You'll see preview with "New" badge
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. ✅ Image uploads to Supabase
7. ✅ Avatar in settings form updates
8. ✅ Avatar in header updates (with cache-bust)
9. Navigate to dashboard → avatar persists
10. Refresh page → avatar still there

## 🔍 **Current Issue: Avatar Cache**

### **The Situation**:
Everything is working in the backend:
- ✅ Image uploads successfully
- ✅ Database updates with new URL  
- ✅ API returns new URL
- ✅ Context gets new avatar_url

### **The UI Issue**:
Avatar component might not update immediately due to:
1. Browser image cache
2. React component cache
3. Radix Avatar internal cache

### **The Fix Applied**:
✅ Cache-busting with version tracking:
```
Original: https://.../image.jpeg
New:      https://.../image.jpeg?v=2
```

Browser treats this as a completely new URL → fetches fresh image!

---

## 🚀 **What You Need to Do**

### **Immediate Actions**:

1. **Hard Refresh Your Browser**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - This loads the new JavaScript with cache-busting code

2. **Test Avatar Upload**
   - Go to `/therapist/dashboard/settings`
   - Upload a new profile picture
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Avatar should update in 2-3 seconds

3. **If Avatar Doesn't Update**:
   - Check browser console for logs
   - Look for: `🔄 TherapistHeader: Avatar URL changed, incrementing version`
   - Manually refresh page (F5) - avatar WILL persist after refresh

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Avatar still doesn't update after save

**Solution 1**: Enable auto page reload

In `app/therapist/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`, uncomment lines 472-474:
```typescript
// Uncomment these lines:
setTimeout(() => {
  window.location.reload()
}, 1500)
```

This forces a full page refresh 1.5 seconds after save, guaranteeing avatar updates everywhere.

**Solution 2**: Use the new Avatar Upload component

Replace the avatar section in settings with:
```tsx
import TherapistAvatarUpload from '@/components/therapist-avatar-upload'

<TherapistAvatarUpload
  avatarUrl={profileImage}
  displayName={therapistUser?.full_name || 'Therapist'}
  isEditing={isEditing}
  onUploadComplete={(url) => {
    setProfileImage(url)
    validateSession()
  }}
/>
```

This component has superior cache-busting and refresh logic built-in.
