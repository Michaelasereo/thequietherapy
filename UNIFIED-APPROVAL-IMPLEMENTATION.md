# Unified Approval System Implementation

## Overview
Consolidated the therapist approval process from two separate approvals (general approval + availability approval) into a single unified approval that covers both.

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Pending Verifications Card
**File:** `components/admin/pending-verifications-card.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed separate "Approve Availability" button
- ✅ Updated "Approve" button to handle both general and availability approval
- ✅ Updated success message to indicate unified approval includes availability
- ✅ Removed `handleAvailabilityApprove` function

**Result:** Admin now sees only one "Approve" button that grants full access to therapists.

### 2. Approval API Route
**File:** `app/api/admin/approve-verification/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed `approvalType` parameter handling
- ✅ Unified approval logic for therapists - single approval now:
  - Updates `therapist_enrollments` table (status, approved_at)
  - Updates `users` table (is_verified, is_active)
- ✅ Removed `handleAvailabilityApproval` function
- ✅ Updated success message to indicate unified approval

**Result:** One approval endpoint that handles everything at once.

### 3. Admin Therapists Page
**File:** `app/admin/dashboard/therapists/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `handleAvailabilityApprove` to use unified approval (removed `approvalType` parameter)
- ✅ Updated UI alert from "Availability Update Process" to "Therapist Approval Process"
- ✅ Updated statistics card from "Availability Approved" to "Verified Therapists"
- ✅ Updated success/error messages to reflect unified approval

**Result:** Admin UI now reflects single approval process.

### 4. Therapist Profile API (No Changes Needed)
**File:** `app/api/therapist/profile/route.ts`

**Existing Logic (Already Correct):**
```typescript
availability_approved: user.is_verified && user.is_active
```

This existing logic automatically sets `availability_approved` to true when a therapist is approved, making the unified approval work seamlessly with existing code.

**Result:** No changes needed - existing logic already supports unified approval.

## How It Works

### Before (Dual Approval):
1. Admin approves therapist → Therapist gets basic access
2. Admin approves availability → Therapist can set availability and accept sessions

### After (Unified Approval):
1. Admin approves therapist → Therapist gets full access including:
   - Account activation (`is_verified: true`, `is_active: true`)
   - Enrollment approval (`status: 'approved'`, `approved_at: timestamp`)
   - Automatic availability approval (`availability_approved: true` via computed field)
   - Ability to set availability
   - Ability to accept sessions

## Database Schema

No database migrations needed. The system uses existing fields:

**therapist_enrollments table:**
- `status`: 'pending' → 'approved' (single approval)
- `approved_at`: timestamp of approval

**users table:**
- `is_verified`: false → true (single approval)
- `is_active`: false → true (single approval)

**Computed field:**
- `availability_approved`: Automatically derived from `is_verified && is_active`

## Testing

To verify the unified approval works:

1. **Create a test therapist enrollment**
2. **Admin approves (single button click)**
3. **Verify therapist can:**
   - Log in to dashboard
   - Access availability settings
   - Set their weekly schedule
   - Accept session bookings
4. **Verify database:**
   - `therapist_enrollments.status = 'approved'`
   - `users.is_verified = true`
   - `users.is_active = true`
   - API returns `availability_approved = true`

## Benefits

✅ **Simplified admin workflow** - One click instead of two
✅ **Better UX** - Less confusing for admins
✅ **Consistent approval process** - No confusion about which approval is needed
✅ **Maintained backward compatibility** - Existing code continues to work
✅ **No database changes required** - Uses existing schema

## Files Modified

1. `components/admin/pending-verifications-card.tsx`
2. `app/api/admin/approve-verification/route.ts`
3. `app/admin/dashboard/therapists/page.tsx`

## Files That Work Without Changes

These files continue to work correctly with the unified approval:

- `app/api/therapist/profile/route.ts` - Automatically computes availability_approved
- `app/therapist/dashboard/availability/page.tsx` - Uses availability_approved flag
- `context/therapist-dashboard-context.tsx` - Consumes availability_approved
- `hooks/useTherapistDashboardState.ts` - Works with existing data structure

## Deployment Notes

✅ No database migrations required
✅ No environment variables needed
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Safe to deploy immediately
