## Option 1: Personal Connection + Vision (Recommended)

```
Hi Dr. [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something exciting with you.

You gave me an internship opportunity a while back, and that experience inspired me to tackle a problem you see daily: patients struggling to access proper care.

I recently launched Quiet Therapy - a HIPAA-compliant platform for mental health that uses AI to reduce administrative burden on clinicians by 80%. It's live, processing real sessions, and helping patients access care faster.

Given your expertise in cancer care and love for innovation, I'd love to explore building something similar specifically for cancer patients. The mental health challenges during cancer treatment are immense, and I believe technology can make a real difference.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about potential partnership opportunities in this space? I'd be honored to have your guidance.

Here's what I've built: thequietherapy.live

Thank you for everything you taught me,
[Your Name]

## Option 2: Data-Focused

```
Hi Dr. [Name],

Quick update from your former intern! 🚀

Built something I think would interest you:

→ Mental health platform using AI to save clinicians 2 hours per session
→ HIPAA-compliant with live video therapy
→ Already operational and processing patients

The cancer space faces similar challenges:
• Patients need access to specialty support
• Clinicians drown in documentation
• Resources are scarce

I see huge potential in adapting this for oncology. Open to exploring partnership opportunities.

Demo: thequietherapy.live

Happy to jump on a call if you're interested!

Best regards,

## Option 3: Direct Ask with Context

```
Dr. [Name],

Thank you again for the internship opportunity you gave me - it fundamentally shaped how I approach healthcare problems.

I've built something I'd love your expert opinion on:

**Quiet Therapy** - A HIPAA-compliant therapy platform that:
• Connects patients with clinicians instantly
• Uses AI to auto-generate session documentation (saves 80% admin time)
• Handles payment and scheduling automatically
• Already live with real patients using it

The mental health parallel to cancer care is striking. I believe the same tech could revolutionize:
→ Patient-clinician communication during treatment
→ Documentation burden in oncology
→ Access to specialty care resources

Interested in exploring a partnership to build something specific for cancer patients?

Here's what I've built: thequietherapy.live

Would you be open to a 20-minute call?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Option 4: Story-Driven

```
Hi Dr. [Name],

Wanted to share a full-circle moment with you.

The internship you gave me showed me the gaps in healthcare access. Fast forward: I've built a solution that's addressing exactly those gaps in mental health.

**Quiet Therapy** - Live platform with:
✅ AI-powered documentation (clinicans love it)
✅ Instant patient access (no wait times)
✅ HIPAA security (enterprise-grade)
✅ Real results (processing payments now)

I remember watching how cancer patients would struggle to access support during treatment. The mental health side of cancer care deserves better technology.

I'd love to explore adapting this platform specifically for oncology patients. Your expertise would be invaluable.

Would you be interested in a conversation about partnership possibilities?

Grateful for your mentorship,
