## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 1: DATABASE MIGRATION (5 minutes)

### Run the SQL Migration:

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database and run:
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f add-onboarding-tracking.sql
```

Or run directly in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add onboarding tracking columns
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_completed_onboarding BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_step INTEGER DEFAULT 1;

-- Grandfather existing users
UPDATE users 
SET has_completed_onboarding = TRUE 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND has_completed_onboarding IS FALSE;
```

### Verify Migration:

```sql
-- Check columns were added
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users' 
  AND column_name IN ('has_completed_onboarding', 'onboarding_data', 'onboarding_step');

-- Check existing users were grandfathered
SELECT 
  has_completed_onboarding,
  COUNT(*) as user_count
FROM users
GROUP BY has_completed_onboarding;
```

## üß™ STEP 2: TEST THE IMPLEMENTATION (15 minutes)

### Test 1: New User Flow

1. **Create a new test user:**
   - Go to `/signup`
   - Enter email and name
   - Submit form
   - Check email for verification link

2. **Verify email and check onboarding:**
   - Click verification link in email
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - **Onboarding modal should appear immediately** ‚ú®
   - Modal should show "Welcome to TRPI! üëã"

3. **Test modal navigation:**
   - Click "Continue" to go to next step
   - Test "Back" button
   - On step 2, verify "Complete Profile" button links to `/dashboard/biodata`
   - Try closing modal without completing (should work after 10 seconds)

4. **Complete onboarding:**
   - Navigate through all 5 steps
   - Click "Complete Setup" on final step
   - Modal should close
   - Refresh page - modal should NOT reappear

### Test 2: Existing User Flow

1. **Log in as existing user:**
   - User created before today should NOT see modal
   - Check database: `has_completed_onboarding` should be TRUE

### Test 3: Different User Types

1. **Test as Individual:**
   - Modal shows therapy-focused content
   - "Complete Profile" points to biodata

2. **Test as Therapist:**
   - Go to `/therapist/dashboard` (if you have therapist account)
   - Modal shows professional-focused content

3. **Test as Partner:**
   - Go to `/partner/dashboard` (if you have partner account)
   - Modal shows organization-focused content

## üé® STEP 3: CUSTOMIZE THE MODAL (Optional - 10 minutes)

### Edit Modal Content:

Open `components/onboarding-modal.tsx` and modify:

```tsx
// Change step content for individual users (lines 24-32)
individual: [
  { title: 'Your Custom Welcome! üëã', description: "Your custom description" },
  // ... add your custom steps
]
```

### Change Modal Styling:

```tsx
// Line 121 - Card max width
<Card className="max-w-md w-full">  // Change to max-w-lg for larger modal

// Line 138 - Progress bar color
className="bg-primary h-2 rounded-full"  // Change bg-primary to your color
```

### Adjust Skip Delay:

```tsx
// Line 71 - Skip button delay
const timer = setTimeout(() => setCanSkip(true), 10000)  // Change 10000 to your ms
```

---

## üöÄ STEP 4: DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Deploying:

- [ ] Database migration ran successfully
- [ ] Existing users marked as `has_completed_onboarding = TRUE`
- [ ] Test user can see modal after signup
- [ ] Modal can be completed and doesn't reappear
- [ ] Skip button works after delay
- [ ] All navigation buttons work correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Deploy to Production:

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add progressive user onboarding modal"

# 2. Push to repository
git push origin main

# 3. Run database migration on production
# (Use Supabase SQL Editor or migration tool)

# 4. Deploy application
# (Vercel/Netlify will auto-deploy or use your deployment method)
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Modal doesn't appear for new users:

**Check:**
1. User's `has_completed_onboarding` in database should be FALSE
2. Browser console for errors
3. `/api/user/onboarding-status` returns correct data
4. User object has valid `id` field

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Manually set user onboarding status
UPDATE users SET has_completed_onboarding = FALSE WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Modal appears for existing users:

**Check:**
1. Database migration ran correctly
2. Users have `has_completed_onboarding = TRUE`

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Mark all old users as completed
UPDATE users 
SET has_completed_onboarding = TRUE 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

### Skip button not appearing:

**Check:**
- Wait 10 seconds on step 1
- Check console for timer errors

**Fix:**
```tsx
// Reduce delay in onboarding-modal.tsx line 71
const timer = setTimeout(() => setCanSkip(true), 3000)  // 3 seconds instead of 10
```

### API errors:

**Check:**
1. Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
2. API routes returning 200 status
3. Cookie `trpi_user` exists

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check .env.local has:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key
```

## üìä MONITORING & ANALYTICS

### Track Onboarding Completion:

```sql
-- Daily onboarding completion rate
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as signup_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_signups,
  SUM(CASE WHEN has_completed_onboarding THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN has_completed_onboarding THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as completion_rate
FROM users
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY signup_date DESC;
```

### Track Step Completion:

```sql
-- Where users are dropping off
SELECT 
  onboarding_step,
  COUNT(*) as users_at_step
FROM users
WHERE has_completed_onboarding = FALSE
GROUP BY onboarding_step
ORDER BY onboarding_step;
```

## üéØ WHAT THIS SOLVES

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ‚ùå Users dumped into empty dashboard | ‚úÖ Friendly 5-step welcome modal |
| ‚ùå No guidance on next steps | ‚úÖ Clear progression with CTAs |
| ‚ùå Can't track onboarding | ‚úÖ Database tracking + analytics |
| ‚ùå Poor first-time UX | ‚úÖ Engaging, skippable flow |
| ‚ùå No profile completion prompt | ‚úÖ Direct links to profile setup |

## üö¶ NEXT STEPS (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Improvements:

1. **Add more detailed steps:**
   - Collect user preferences in modal
   - Save to `onboarding_data` JSON column

2. **Progress persistence:**
   - Save current step to database
   - Resume where user left off

3. **Analytics integration:**
   - Track modal views
   - Track completion rates
   - A/B test different flows

4. **Email follow-ups:**
   - Send reminder if onboarding incomplete after 24h
   - Include deep link to continue onboarding

## üìû SUPPORT
