Hi team! 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

Quick update: I've built Quiet Therapy - a healthcare platform that could help us all.

What it does:
✅ Connects patients to therapists instantly
✅ AI handles session documentation (saves 2+ hours)
✅ HIPAA-compliant & secure
✅ Already live at thequietherapy.live

I need your support: Please sign up to test it out! 

Beyond that - I see huge potential to adapt this for medical schools, house officers, and residents. Could be a game-changer for mental health support in our community.
