Therapist: That's a common concern. What specifically are you worried about?
Patient: I'm afraid I'll forget what to say or that people will judge me.
Therapist: Those are valid fears. Let's work on some coping strategies together.
Patient: That would be really helpful. I just want to feel more confident.
Therapist: We can definitely work on that. Let's start with some breathing exercises.`
