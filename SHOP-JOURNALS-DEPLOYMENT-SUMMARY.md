## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. Shop Journals Page

- Visible on desktop and mobile views

### 3. Content Security Policy Update
**Location:** `next.config.js`

Added CloudFront CDN domains to CSP for Ecwid resources:
- `script-src`: Added `https://d34ikvsdm2rlij.cloudfront.net` and `https://*.cloudfront.net`
- `style-src`: Added `https://*.cloudfront.net`
- `font-src`: Added `https://*.cloudfront.net`

### 4. Authentication Improvements
**Locations:** Multiple files

**Middleware** (`middleware.ts`):
- Now properly validates JWT sessions
- Clears expired/invalid cookies automatically
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login

**API Routes** (`app/api/auth/me/route.ts`):
- Removed legacy session cookie fallbacks
- Simplified to use unified `quiet_session` only
- Cleaner error handling

**Session Managers**:
- `lib/server-session-manager.ts`: Edge-compatible JWT validation
- `lib/client-session-manager.ts`: Reduced logging

- **Platform:** Code integration
- **Script Loading:** Next.js Script component
- **Strategy:** LazyOnload for performance
- **Initialization:** useEffect with retry logic

### CSP Configuration
Netlify uses the CSP headers defined in `next.config.js`. The `netlify.toml` file is configured with the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` which handles Next.js runtime requirements.

### Build Status
