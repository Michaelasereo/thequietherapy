## 📊 Database Schema Verification

These columns already exist (from `add-therapist-profile-fields.sql`):

```sql
ALTER TABLE therapist_enrollments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gender VARCHAR(20);

ALTER TABLE therapist_enrollments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS age INTEGER;

ALTER TABLE therapist_enrollments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS marital_status VARCHAR(20);

-- Bio column should already exist from original schema
```

✅ No database migration needed!

## 🔄 Data Migration for Existing Therapists

If you have existing therapists in the database with empty fields, you can:

### Option 1: Let them fill it in settings
- Existing therapists login
- See empty fields
- Can edit and fill them

### Option 2: Set defaults in database
```sql
-- Set default values for existing therapists
UPDATE therapist_enrollments
SET 
  gender = 'Prefer not to say',
  age = 0,
  marital_status = 'Not specified',
  bio = 'Professional therapist committed to helping clients.'
WHERE gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR marital_status IS NULL OR bio IS NULL;
```
