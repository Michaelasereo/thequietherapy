## ⚙️ CRITICAL: Verify Environment Variables

Before your site works in production, make sure these are set in Netlify:

### **Go to:** Site Settings → Environment Variables

**Required Variables:**

```bash

# Email (Brevo/Sendinblue)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key

# App URL

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Build Failed"
**Check Netlify Deploy Logs:**
1. Netlify Dashboard → Deploys
2. Click on the failed deploy
3. View logs for errors
4. Common issues:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Build command errors
   - Dependency issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally but fails on Netlify:
# - Check Node version (should be 18)
# - Verify all env vars are set
# - Clear cache and redeploy
```

### Issue: "Site loads but features don't work"
**Missing Environment Variables**
1. Check Netlify Environment Variables
2. Make sure all required vars are set
3. Redeploy after adding vars

### Issue: "Video sessions don't work"
**Check Daily.co Settings:**
1. Verify `DAILY_API_KEY` is set in Netlify
2. Verify `DAILY_DOMAIN` is correct
3. Test API key:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://api.daily.co/v1/rooms \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DAILY_API_KEY"
   ```

### Issue: "Database errors"
**Check Supabase Connection:**
1. Verify all 3 Supabase env vars are set
2. Check RLS policies are enabled
3. Test connection from Netlify Functions
