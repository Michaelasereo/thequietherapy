Hi Dr. [Name],

Hope you're well! Former intern here with something to share.

You gave me an internship that sparked my interest in healthcare innovation. I've since built Quiet Therapy - a HIPAA-compliant mental health platform using AI to save clinicians 2 hours per session. It's live and processing real patients.

Given your expertise in cancer care and passion for innovation, I'd love to explore partnering to adapt this technology for cancer patients specifically. The mental health challenges during treatment are immense, and I believe this could make a real difference.

Would you be open to a brief conversation?

What I've built: thequietherapy.live

Thank you for the mentorship,
[Your Name]
