## 🔒 **SECURITY FEATURES**

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- ✅ Therapists can only see their own data
- ✅ Users can only see their own session data
- ✅ Admins have access to all data

### **Access Control**

## 💰 **MANUAL PAYOUT SYSTEM**

### **How It Works**
1. **Session Completion** → `calculate_therapist_earnings()` called
2. **Platform Fee Applied** → Default 15% (configurable by admin)
3. **Earnings Recorded** → `therapist_earnings` table
4. **Transaction Logged** → `therapist_transactions` table
5. **Manual Payout** → Admin processes payouts manually

### **Earnings Calculation**
```sql
platform_fee_amount = session_cost * platform_fee_percentage / 100
net_amount = session_cost - platform_fee_amount
```
