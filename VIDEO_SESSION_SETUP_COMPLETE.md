## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to a Video Session

```
http://localhost:3000/video-session/[session-id]
```

### Step 3: Test Recording Flow

1. **Join Session:**
   - Click "Start Session" button
   - Video call should load in Daily.co frame
   - Should see recording controls in top-right corner

2. **Start Recording:**
   - Click "Start Recording" button
   - Timer should start counting
   - Recording indicator should show

3. **Speak for Testing:**
   - Say something like: "This is a test therapy session. The patient is discussing anxiety management techniques."
   - Continue for at least 30 seconds

4. **Stop Recording:**
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - Should see "Transcribing audio..." message
   - Wait 5-10 seconds for transcription

5. **Verify Transcription:**
   - Transcript should appear below recording controls
   - Should match what you said
   - Should see success toast: "Session recorded and transcribed!"

6. **Complete Session:**
   - Recording automatically triggers session completion
   - Should see: "AI SOAP notes generated successfully!"
   - Or manually call: `POST /api/sessions/complete` with `{ sessionId }`

### Step 4: Verify in Database

```sql
-- Check transcript was saved
SELECT 
  id, 
  session_id, 
  transcript, 
  created_at 
FROM session_notes 
WHERE session_id = 'your-session-id';

-- Check SOAP notes were generated
SELECT 
  id, 
  soap_notes, 
  ai_notes_generated, 
  ai_notes_generated_at 
FROM sessions 
WHERE id = 'your-session-id';
```

### Step 5: View in Therapist Dashboard

```
http://localhost:3000/therapist/dashboard/client-sessions
```

1. Go to "Past Sessions" tab
2. Find your test session
3. Click "View Notes"
4. Should see:
   - AI-Generated SOAP Notes section
   - Transcript content
   - All formatted properly

## ✅ Expected Results

### Before Fixes (Old Behavior):
- ❌ Video iframe only, no recording
- ❌ SOAP notes showed template text
- ❌ Transcript not used

### After Fixes (New Behavior):
- ✅ Video call with recording controls
- ✅ Recording captures audio
- ✅ Transcription automatic via OpenAI Whisper
- ✅ Real transcript stored in database
- ✅ SOAP notes generated by DeepSeek AI
- ✅ Notes based on actual session content
- ✅ Complete workflow end-to-end

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Recording button doesn't appear

**Check:**
1. Are you in therapy phase? (Not waiting/buffer)
2. Is `callObject` initialized? (Check console logs)
3. Did Daily.co frame load successfully?

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check console for these logs:
🎥 Initializing Daily.co call object for recording...
✅ Joined Daily.co call
```

### Issue: "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY not configured"

**Check:**
1. Is `.env.local` file present?
2. Is `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set correctly?
3. Did you restart dev server after adding env vars?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Transcription shows "No speech detected"

**Check:**
1. Did you actually speak during recording?
2. Was audio at least 2-3 seconds long?
3. Is microphone permission granted?

**Solution:**
- Record for at least 30 seconds
- Speak clearly
- Check browser microphone permissions

### Issue: SOAP notes not generated

**Check console logs for:**
```
⚠️ No transcript found for session: [id]
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure recording completed successfully
- Check `session_notes` table has transcript
- Verify DeepSeek API key is valid

## 💰 Cost Estimates (DeepSeek)

- **Per Session:** ~$0.003 (very cheap!)
- **100 sessions/month:** $0.30
- **1,000 sessions/month:** $3.00
- **10,000 sessions/month:** $30.00

**Note:** OpenAI Whisper transcription costs ~$0.006 per minute of audio.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Auto-Start Recording (Recommended)
Add to `/components/daily-audio-recorder.tsx`:

```typescript
// Auto-start recording when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  if (callObject && !recording) {
    console.log('🎙️ Auto-starting recording...')
    setTimeout(() => {
      startRecording()
    }, 2000) // Wait 2s for call to connect
  }
}, [callObject])
```

### 2. Notes Editing
- Add edit button in therapist dashboard
- Create textarea for editing SOAP notes
- Add save API endpoint

### 3. PDF Export
- Add "Export to PDF" button
- Use library like `jspdf` or `react-pdf`
- Include session details, transcript, and SOAP notes

### 4. Session Summary
- Generate brief summary (2-3 sentences)
- Display in dashboard list view
- Use same DeepSeek API
