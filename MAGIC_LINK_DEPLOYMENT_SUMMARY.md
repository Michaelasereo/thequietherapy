## 🔧 System Architecture

### Magic Link Flow

```
1. User requests magic link
   ↓
2. System validates user exists & type matches
   ↓
3. Generate unique token with expiration
   ↓
4. Store token in database
   ↓
5. Send email with magic link
   ↓
6. User clicks link
   ↓
7. System verifies token (one-time use)
   ↓
8. Create JWT session
   ↓
9. Set secure cookies
   ↓
10. Redirect to appropriate dashboard
```

### Security Features

- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 10 magic link requests per hour per email
- ✅ **Token Expiration**: 24 hours for regular users, 15 minutes for healthcare workers
- ✅ **One-Time Use**: Tokens marked as used atomically to prevent reuse
- ✅ **User Type Validation**: Prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ **Secure Sessions**: JWT-based with HttpOnly cookies
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: All actions logged for security monitoring
