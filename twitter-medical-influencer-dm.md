## Twitter DM Best Practices

✅ **Keep under 250 words** (shorter = better)  
✅ **Reference their content** (shows you actually follow them)  
✅ **Clear value prop** (what's in it for them)  
✅ **Specific ask** (feedback, retweet, partnership?)  
✅ **Proof link** (live site demonstrates you're real)  
✅ **Be respectful** (they get many DMs)

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't pitch investment outright in first message  
❌ Don't spam multiple DMs  
❌ Don't ask for free promotion  
❌ Don't be pushy  
❌ Don't ignore their content

---

## My Recommendation

**Use Option 1** if you don't know them well  
**Use Option 3** if you follow their content  
**Use Option 5** if you want maximum brevity

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

If they don't respond in 7 days:

```
Hey [Name], just circling back on my previous message about Quiet Therapy. 

If you have 30 seconds to check: thequietherapy.live

No worries if not - thanks for all the great content you share!
```

Then let it go - don't push further.

**Good luck! Twitter medical influencers can be great advocates if you approach them right.** 🎯
