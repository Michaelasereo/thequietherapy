# Logo Update Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the new Quiet Therapy logo files into the application.

## New Logo Files
✅ **White Logo**: `quiet-logo-whitee.png` (for dark backgrounds)
✅ **Black Logo**: `quiet-logo-black.png` (for light backgrounds)

Both files are properly placed in the `/public` directory and ready for use.

## Files Updated

### 1. Logo Component
**File:** `components/ui/logo.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated to use new logo filenames
- ✅ Fixed typo in black logo reference (removed extra 'k')
- ✅ Maintains variant support (light/dark/auto)
- ✅ Preserves size options (sm/md/lg)

**Usage:**
```tsx
<Logo variant="light" size="md" />  // Uses quiet-logo-whitee.png
<Logo variant="dark" size="lg" />   // Uses quiet-logo-black.png
<Logo variant="auto" />             // Auto-selects based on theme
```

### 2. SEO Structured Data
**File:** `app/layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated schema.org logo reference to use new logo
- ✅ Changed from `logo-black.svg` to `quiet-logo-black.png`

## Current Logo Usage

The Logo component is used throughout the application in:
- ✅ Login pages (therapist, admin, partner)
- ✅ Dashboard headers and sidebars
- ✅ Landing page navigation
- ✅ Footer components
- ✅ SEO structured data

## Optional Next Steps

### 1. PWA Icons (Optional)
Current PWA icons (`icon-192x192.png`, `icon-512x512.png`) are still using the old design.

**If you want to update them:**
- Create new 192x192 and 512x512 versions from your new logo
- Replace the existing files in `/public`
- No code changes needed (references are already correct)

### 2. Favicon (Optional)
You might want to create a favicon.ico based on your new logo design.

### 3. Social Media Images (Optional)
Consider creating og-image.jpg and other social sharing images using the new logo.
