## üìã **Pre-Test Setup**

### Step 1: Create Test Accounts

You'll need at least 2 accounts:
1. **Patient/User** - To book sessions
2. **Therapist** - To conduct sessions

#### Option A: Manual Signup
1. Go to `/signup` or `/login`
2. Create a patient account
3. Create a therapist account (separate browser/incognito)

#### Option B: Quick SQL Setup
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to create test accounts:

```sql
-- Create test patient
INSERT INTO users (email, full_name, user_type, is_verified, credits)
VALUES ('patient@test.com', 'Test Patient', 'individual', true, 10)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET credits = 10;

-- Create test therapist
INSERT INTO users (email, full_name, user_type, is_verified)
VALUES ('therapist@test.com', 'Dr. Test Therapist', 'therapist', true)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;

-- Create therapist enrollment (for approval)
INSERT INTO therapist_enrollments (email, full_name, status)
VALUES ('therapist@test.com', 'Dr. Test Therapist', 'approved')
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET status = 'approved';
```

**Note:** You'll still need to sign up via the UI to set passwords and get Supabase Auth accounts.
