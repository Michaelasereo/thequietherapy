## ‚ö° Fast Setup (5 minutes)

### STEP 1: Create Test Accounts (1 minute)

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Quick test therapist
INSERT INTO users (id, email, user_type, email_verified, credits)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'quicktest-therapist@test.com', 'therapist', true, 0)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET user_type = 'therapist', email_verified = true
RETURNING id;

-- Save the therapist ID from above, then create profile:
INSERT INTO therapist_profiles (id, user_id, full_name, specialization, hourly_rate, is_verified, is_active)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'PASTE_THERAPIST_ID_HERE', -- Replace with ID from above
  'Test Therapist',
  'Clinical Psychology',
  5000,
  true,
  true
);

-- Quick test patient with credits
INSERT INTO users (id, email, user_type, email_verified, credits)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'quicktest-patient@test.com', 'individual', true, 10)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET credits = 10, email_verified = true;
```

**Talk naturally about a test scenario:**

üó£Ô∏è Say things like:
- "I've been feeling stressed about work lately"
- "The long hours are affecting my sleep"
- "I'm worried about burnout"
- "What coping strategies would you recommend?"

**Keep talking for at least 3-5 minutes so transcription has content!**

Look for:
- ‚úÖ Video works both sides
- ‚úÖ Audio is clear
- ‚úÖ Timer counting down from 30:00
- ‚úÖ Recording indicator (red dot or "Recording" button)

**If you see "Start Recording" button - CLICK IT!**

### STEP 8: End Session

- Wait for timer to reach 00:00 OR
- Click "End Session" button

### STEP 9: Check Results (2-5 minutes)

**In Therapist Dashboard:**

1. Go to "Client Sessions" or "Session Notes"
2. Find your completed session
3. Click "View Details" or expand it

**You should see:**

üìù **Transcript Section:**
```
[Should show what you just said in the conversation]
"I've been feeling stressed about work lately..."
```

üè• **AI SOAP Notes Section:**
```
Subjective: Patient reports feeling stressed...
Objective: Patient appeared calm during session...
Assessment: Symptoms consistent with work-related stress...
Plan: Recommend stress management techniques...
```

**If you DON'T see notes yet:**
- Wait 2-3 more minutes (AI processing takes time)
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

## üéØ What You're Testing

‚úÖ **Video Connection** - Does video/audio work?
‚úÖ **Recording** - Does it capture your conversation?
‚úÖ **Transcription** - Does it convert speech to text accurately?
‚úÖ **AI SOAP Notes** - Does AI generate clinical notes?
‚úÖ **Dashboard Display** - Can you view notes in dashboard?

## üêõ Quick Troubleshooting

### Can't login?
- Check your terminal for magic link logs
- Look for: `Magic link token: [your-token]`
- Manually construct: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/verify-email?token=[token]&email=[email]&user_type=therapist`

### Video won't connect?
- Check browser console (F12)
- Ensure camera/mic permissions granted
- Try refreshing the page

### Recording not working?
- Make sure you clicked "Start Recording" if you see the button
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify microphone is active (green indicator)

### No transcript after session?
- Wait 5 minutes total
- Check: `/app/therapist/dashboard/client-sessions`
- Check browser Network tab for API errors
- Look in Supabase `session_notes` table directly

### No SOAP notes?
- These depend on transcript being generated first
- May take 5-10 minutes total
- Check if `sessions` table has `soap_notes` column populated

## üîç Manual Verification (if needed)

**Check Supabase directly:**

```sql
-- See your session
SELECT * FROM sessions 
WHERE therapist_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'quicktest-therapist@test.com'
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- See transcript
SELECT * FROM session_notes
WHERE session_id = 'YOUR_SESSION_ID_FROM_ABOVE';

-- See if SOAP notes generated
SELECT id, soap_notes FROM sessions
WHERE id = 'YOUR_SESSION_ID'
AND soap_notes IS NOT NULL;
```
