-- Fix booking issue: Update existing approved therapists to have verification_status = 'approved' in therapist_profiles
-- This fixes the 409 conflict error when booking

-- Step 1: Show current state
SELECT 
    'Current therapist_profiles state:' as info,
    u.email,

-- Step 2: Update all therapist_profiles that should be approved
UPDATE therapist_profiles tp
SET 
    verification_status = 'approved',

      AND u.is_verified = true
      AND u.is_active = true
)
AND (tp.verification_status != 'approved' OR tp.is_verified != true);

-- Step 3: Create missing therapist_profiles for approved therapists
INSERT INTO therapist_profiles (
