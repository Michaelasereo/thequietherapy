WHERE email = 'ceo@thequietherapy.live' 
  AND user_type = 'therapist';
```

### Step 2: Verify Fix
```sql
-- Check the result:
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.is_active as user_active,
  e.is_active as enrollment_active
FROM users u
JOIN therapist_enrollments e ON u.email = e.email
WHERE u.email = 'ceo@thequietherapy.live';
```

### Step 3: Test Availability

3. Verify toggle works
4. Test booking flow
