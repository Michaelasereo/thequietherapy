# Guest Booking Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete guest booking flow that allows users to book therapy sessions from the landing page without being logged in. After payment, users receive an email verification link that either logs them into an existing account or creates a new account, and then automatically creates their therapy session.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Booking Step 4 Component** (`components/booking-step-4.tsx`)
- **Removed mock data**: Eliminated hardcoded user credits and email
- **Simplified payment flow**: Changed to Paystack-only payment (no credits for guest users)
- **Updated patient data**: Changed from `patientData.name` to `patientData.firstName` for consistency
- **Added metadata to payment**: Included comprehensive booking data in Paystack metadata for processing after payment
- **User-friendly messaging**: Added information about email verification after payment

### 2. **Created Email Verification Modal** (`components/email-verification-modal.tsx`)
A new modal component that displays after successful payment with:
- Success message confirming payment
- Email verification instructions
- Clear explanation that clicking the verification link will either:
  - Log into an existing account
  - Create a new account
- Information about accessing the dashboard to view session details
- Reminder to check spam folder
- Button to go to login page

### 3. **Updated Book Session Page** (`app/book-session/page.tsx`)
- **Added URL parameter handling**: Detects when user returns from Paystack with successful payment
- **Integrated verification modal**: Shows modal automatically after payment success
- **Updated booking completion**: Calls API to store booking and send verification email
- **Clean user experience**: Form starts with empty fields for guest users to fill in

### 4. **Created Guest Booking API Endpoint** (`app/api/bookings/create-guest-booking/route.ts`)
New API endpoint that:
- Validates booking data from payment
- Generates a secure verification token
- Stores booking data in `magic_links` table with metadata
- Sends a beautiful email via Brevo with:
  - Payment confirmation
  - Session details (date, time, duration)
  - Verification button/link
  - Instructions for accessing dashboard
  - 24-hour expiration notice

### 5. **Enhanced Paystack Verification** (`app/api/paystack/verify/route.ts`)
- **Added session_booking type handling**: Detects guest bookings vs logged-in user bookings
- **Automatic booking creation**: Calls the guest booking API after successful payment
- **Smart redirection**: Redirects back to book-session page with success parameters
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles booking creation errors while still showing success

### 6. **Enhanced Email Verification Flow** (`app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts`)
- **Booking data detection**: Checks for booking data in verification metadata
- **Automatic session creation**: Creates therapy session in database after email verification
- **Complete user onboarding**: 
  1. Creates or gets existing user
  2. Verifies email
  3. Creates therapy session with payment marked as paid
  4. Creates user session
  5. Redirects to dashboard where session is visible

## User Flow

### 1. **Booking Process**
1. User clicks "Book a Session" from landing page
2. User fills in contact information (name, email, phone, etc.)
3. User selects preferred therapist
4. User selects available time slot
5. User proceeds to payment

### 2. **Payment Process**
1. User is redirected to Paystack for payment
2. User completes payment securely
3. Paystack verifies payment and creates guest booking
4. User is redirected back to book-session page
5. Email verification modal appears automatically

### 3. **Email Verification Process**
1. User receives email with verification link
2. User clicks verification link
3. System either:
   - Logs user into existing account, OR
   - Creates new account with provided information
4. System creates therapy session in database
5. User is redirected to dashboard
6. Session is visible in dashboard with all details
